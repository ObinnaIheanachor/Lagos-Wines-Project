This repository contains files used in creating a Power BI report which will be developed into a web app that helps wine consumers in Lagos, Nigeria purchase wines at the best prices.

The data was gotten using web scraping and the extracted data was then preprocessed and analyzed in Power BI.

The winestores analyzed include [Konga](https://www.konga.com/category/wines-2004?page=1), [Drinks In Lagos](https://www.drinksinlagos.com/), [DrinksNG](https://www.drinks.ng/shop/wine/), [Jumia](https://www.jumia.com.ng/wines/), [Cellar Central](https://www.cellarcentral.ng/index.php?_route_=wines&page=1), and [WineHouse Nigeria](https://winehousenigeria.com/product-category/wine/).
